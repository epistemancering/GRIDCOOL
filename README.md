Move by either clicking the arrows or using your keyboard. Once your opponent is in your sights, you'll fire automatically, ending the match in an instant.

* ### deception

There's no telling where your opponent will be, since they move at the same time as you...

After your first match, create an account and set your signature color. This will be visible to opponents, so be sure to choose an insultingly garish hue.

* ### player records
